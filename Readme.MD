Wizard Run

This is my first attempt at making a Flash game with Starling GPU-accelerated Stage3D rendering framework.
This will be a simple runner game, priority target is web, but maybe I'll port it to mobile platforms later.
In-game text is still non-localized and available only in Russian, but I'll make at least English translation later.

Requirements:
- Starling v.2.1,
- DragonBones (I'm using v.5.0 and DragonBones Pro editor, but data format is v.4.0),
- TweenLite.
